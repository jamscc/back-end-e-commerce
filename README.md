# E-COMMERCE (BACK END)

## Description

Users can use the links below to observe a back-end that has been built as part of an e-commerce site (starter code / framework provided by edX Boot Camps LLC). As part of the application, there are various models (Category, Product, Tag, and ProductTag), routes (get and post as well as delete and put), and methods in connection with CRUD. Please see the link to the repository below. The use of Express.js, Node.js, Sequelize, MySQL2, MySQL, and the dotenv package can be observed from there. 

As for the testing of the various routes, Thunder Client was used (as shown in the walkthrough video). Please see below for the link to the video.
